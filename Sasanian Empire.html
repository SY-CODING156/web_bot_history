<p id="ok">The Second Persian Empire or (Sasanian Empire) is an empire that existed between the third and seventh centuries AD in the Middle East, where it was the only competitor to the Roman Empire and was going to destroy it.
 Ardashir I, or Ardashir Ibn Babak, Ibn Sasan, who was born in the year 180 AD in Tirudah from the villages of the city of Istakhr, is considered the founder of the Sasanian Empire after he overthrew the Parthian Empire in the year 224 AD
 The presence of the Sasanian Empire lasted for a period of 425 AD from the year 226 AD to 651 AD.
